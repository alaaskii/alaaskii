    <p><b>Open world is a type of video game level design concept, where the player can freely roam the virtual world and change any factor to his liking. This sentence describes the game environment itself and indicates the absence of some artificial barriers. Despite being called games by this name, many open-world games still impose restrictions at some points in the game environment, either due to absolute limitations in game design or temporary limitations within the game (such as locked areas) imposed by linear games. The game's levels are designed as wide open areas with many ways to reach the goal.</b></p>

    <P style="color:brown"><b><ins>For my personal part, I nominate the following games as the best games so far:</ins></b></P>
    <h4 style="color:blue"><ins>1-ELDEN_RING:</ins></h4>
    <p><b>This game is considered one of the best and most difficult types of games because it is a Souls game, and it is the only Souls game that contains an open world next to Skyro, and it won the award for the best game in 2022. It is also considered one of the most difficult Souls games after Skyro, due to the strength of its leaders, the road, and its long journey in terms of story alone, without mentioning it. Outside the story, there are unlimited explorations, bosses, and missions. In order to complete the game completely, you must complete 3 or 4 endings to the game, and this is the game in brief.  </b></p>

   <h4 style="color:blue"><ins>2-RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2:</ins></h4>
   <p><b>This game is considered a fantastically realistic open world game that enables you to live reality and the spirit of adventure. It enables you to hunt animals and create relationships with people. You can be as you want, either a good or a bad person. Above all, it has a very legendary story where you can play in the story mode. With two characters, this game is written by Rockstar Games, and I declare that it is the second best open world game after Den Ring, in my personal opinion, according to my own experience, and I take platinum in both games. A light explanation and review link is in the video here.</b></p>

   <h4 style="color:blue"><ins>2-GRAND THEF AUTO V:</ins></h4>
   <p><b>There are a number of players who advised their friends to stay on the PlayStation 4 version, and there is no compelling reason to move to the new generation version.

From our point of view, we believe that Rockstar would have been the first to provide the new generation upgrade for free to everyone who owns the previous generation version. It only makes profits and returns through internal sales in GTA Online. But it seems that the greed of Rockstar and its parent company T2 will not stop there. You can view our criticism of GTA 5, the new generation version, here, and share your opinions with us.

GTA 5 is now available on new generation devices with improvements that include support for 4K resolution with performance up to 60 frames per second, support for ray tracing technology, and some minor visual improvements.</b></p>
